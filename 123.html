        <h2>ADVENTURE TIME !</h2>
        <p class="text">An adventure is an exciting experience or undertaking that is typically bold, sometimes risky. Adventures may be activities with danger such as traveling, exploring, skydiving, mountain climbing, scuba diving, river rafting, or other extreme sports. 
            <br><br>
            Adventures are often undertaken to create psychological arousal or in order to achieve a greater goal, such as the pursuit of knowledge that can only be obtained by such activities

        <h2 class="desc">PARA GLIDING</h2>   </div>
        <p class="text"> Paragliding is the recreational and competitive adventure sport of flying paragliders: lightweight, free-flying, foot-launched glider aircraft with no rigid primary structure. The pilot sits in a harness or lies prone in a cocoon-like 'pod' suspended below a fabric wing
            <br><br>
            Wing shape is maintained by the suspension lines, the pressure of air entering vents in the front of the wing, and the aerodynamic forces of the air flowing over the outside.

    <div class="bg bg3">
        <h2 class="desc">SURFING</h2>  </div>
        <p class="text">Surfing is a surface water sport in which an individual, a surfer (or two in tandem surfing), uses a board to ride on the forward section, or face, of a moving wave of water, which usually carries the surfer towards the shore
            <br><br>
            Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found on ocean shores, but can also be found in standing waves in the open ocean, in lakes, in rivers in the form of a tidal bore, or in wave pools.
        </p>

    <div class="bg bg4">
        <h2 class="desc">RIVER RAFTING</h2>
    </div>
    <p class="text">
        Rafting and whitewater rafting are recreational outdoor activities which use an inflatable raft to navigate a river or other body of water. This is often done on whitewater or different degrees of rough water. Dealing with risk is often a part of the experience.
        <br><br>
        Rafting on certain sections of rivers is considered an extreme sport and can be fatal, while other sections are not so extreme or difficult. 
    </p>

    <div class="bg bg5"><h2 class="desc">MOUNTAIN CLIMBING</h2></div>
    <p class="text">Mountaineering, mountain climbing, or alpinism, is a set of outdoor activities that involves ascending mountains. Mountaineering-related activities include traditional outdoor climbing, skiing, and traversing via ferratas that have become sports in their own right.
  <br><br>
  Mountaineering activity, involving such activities as mountain climbing and trekking, has traditionally been dominated by men. Although women's participation in mountaineering has grown, the gender gap is still pronounced in terms of quantitative engagement in these forms of sport tourism. Yet, in competitive mountaineering, the success rate of females is currently higher than that of males
